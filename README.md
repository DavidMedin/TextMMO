# Text MMO Server
A text based rpg game. Maybe inspired by Sokpop.

This game features an ECS system to manage the game data. This allows more flexible features, such as a card and deck based combat system.
The game is played through a terminal-like interface, where there is only text. In the game, you have a hand of cards that is accessed by entering `show h`, and an inventory, accessed with `show i`.


The room you are in can be viewed with the `look` command, which shows and indexes the things in the room. By `target`ing one of the objects in the room, like `the orc`, you can target and attack them.
